      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      What started as required high school art credit has developed into an incredible passion.
      My passion for photography started at the age of 15 and has steadily continued to grow.
      6 years later and I'm starting to turn a dream into reality.
      I specialize in portraits but am always willing to expand.
      My goal is to capture what truely lies behind a model and
      not just their beauty but also their inner strength and passion.
